# TODO

Releases:
- Curently developing version: 0.1
- Next version: 0.2
- ...


### General

+ Add error message provided in response body into an exception throw
+ run integration tests manually
+ Encode URL (don't encode special characters)
+ Consistency modes
+ Blocking queries (simple)
+ Don't expose json11 in headers
+ Add CMake 3 support
+ build library as shared (default) or static (choosen by option)
- Suppress all warnings. Possibly enable -Werror
- Add async API (cURL multi handle?) (postponed to 0.2)
- More checks of received JSON data shape (?)
- Simplify JSON interface (?)
- Don't use regex for CURL headers (it creates dependency on Boost.Regex compiled library on gcc 4.8)
- provide comparision operators (at least ==, !=) for all structs defined (postponed to 0.2)
- Support 64bit integers in JSON (postponed to 0.2)
- tests for consistency / default consistency (if possible)
- pkg-config: add Libs.private and Requires

### HTTP(S)
? allow user to set CURLOPT_SSLENGINE and CURLOPT_SSLENGINE_DEFAULT (consul 0.2)
? allow user to set CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST
    or set it by ourself to something highly secure (check what Consul supports) (consul 0.2)
? allow user to set CURLOPT_ISSUERCERT (consul 0.2)
? allow user to set CURLOPT_PINNEDPUBLICKEY (consul 0.2)
? allow user to set CURLOPT_CRLFILE (consul 0.2)
? allow user to set some other HTTP(S) options supported by cURL
? use Consul::setOption() instead of adding all of this to TlsOptions?

### CI

+ build for 3 platforms (Windows, Linux, OSX)
+ run unit-tests
+ run integration tests (+Windows, +Linux , +OSX)
+ operator << for std::duration for tests
+ split consul tests into different executables

### Consul
+ Change 'block-for' resolution from seconds to milliseconds
- tests for default DC and default token (postponed to 0.2)


### kv

+ v1 interface except acquire/release lock and consistency modes
+ Decode value from base64
+ Integration tests
+ URL encode keys (key may contain any char from 0 to 255)
+ ensure value can contain any char from 0 to 255
+ Consistency modes
+ Blocking queries (simple)
- Acquire/release lock (depends on session)
- Get flag as uin64_t. Now it extracted from JSON as double because of json11 limitations - switch to RapidJSON

- throwing `std::string get(key, params...)` i.e. w/o a default value
- `boost::optional<std::string> getOptional(key, params...)`
- lazy items iterator
- ? syntax sugar operator[] to simply get/put value w/o params. getter returns "" if key does not exist (postponed to 0.2?)
- tests for dc (postponed to 0.2)
- tests for default DC and default token (postponed to 0.2)
- typed value access (postponed to 0.2)


### agent

+ v1 interface except Config part of /v1/agent/self
+ Additional check types (https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/checks.html)
  + HTTP
  + TCP
  + Docker
+ Support "Notes" for a service's check
- Support multiple checks for a service
- Support "Status" (plus "Output"?) for a check's initial status
- agent/maintenance (https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/http/agent.html#agent_maintenance)
- agent/service/maintenance (https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/http/agent.html#agent_service_maintenance)

- Config part of /v1/agent/self (postponed to 0.2)


### catalog

+ tests
+ tests for block_for

- tests for dc (postponed to 0.2)
- tests for default DC (postponed to 0.2)
- register/deregister (no reason to implement)
